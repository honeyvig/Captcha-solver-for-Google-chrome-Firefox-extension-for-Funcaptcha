------------
Solving Funcaptcha (and other similar CAPTCHAs) using browser extensions or APIs like 2Captcha can be an effective method. However, it’s important to note that automating CAPTCHA solving might violate some websites’ Terms of Service (ToS), so use these tools responsibly and in compliance with relevant rules.

I will guide you through setting up a simple solution that integrates 2Captcha (or a similar CAPTCHA solving service) with a Google Chrome or Firefox extension.
Steps to Solve Funcaptcha with 2Captcha API
Step 1: Sign up on 2Captcha (or a similar service)

    Go to 2Captcha and sign up for an account.
    Once registered, you’ll get an API Key. Keep it safe, as you will need it to solve CAPTCHAs using their service.

Step 2: Use a Chrome or Firefox Extension to Solve CAPTCHAs

There are some extensions available that integrate 2Captcha with your browser to solve CAPTCHAs automatically.
For Google Chrome:

You can use the 2Captcha Chrome extension, which will automatically handle CAPTCHA solving.

    Install 2Captcha Extension for Chrome:
        You can download the official 2Captcha extension from the Chrome Web Store, or you can use a third-party extension like Buster: Captcha Solver for Humans (which uses 2Captcha in the background).
        2Captcha Extension (Official):
            2Captcha Extension (Search for it in the Chrome Web Store)
        Buster: Captcha Solver for Humans:
            Buster Extension

    Configure the Extension:
        After installing the extension, you will need to input your 2Captcha API key into the extension’s settings.
        The extension will then automatically solve Funcaptcha puzzles for you when you encounter them in the browser.

For Firefox:

You can install the 2Captcha Firefox extension, which works similarly to the Chrome extension.

    Install 2Captcha Extension for Firefox:
        There are various extensions available for Firefox that integrate with 2Captcha.
        Search for the 2Captcha Auto Solver extension on Firefox Add-ons.

    Configure the Extension:
        Input your 2Captcha API key into the extension settings, and it will start solving CAPTCHAs.

Step 3: Using 2Captcha API with Scripts (Advanced)

If you want to have more control over the process and be able to integrate the CAPTCHA-solving process into your personal scripts or automation, you can use the 2Captcha API directly.

Here is a basic example of how you can interact with the 2Captcha API to solve Funcaptcha:

    Install Python (if you don't have it installed already):
        Download and install Python from python.org.

    Install the requests library:
        Run pip install requests in your terminal or command prompt to install the required library for making HTTP requests.

    Python Code Example:

import time
import requests

API_KEY = 'YOUR_2CAPTCHA_API_KEY'  # Replace with your 2Captcha API key

# Step 1: Request a CAPTCHA to solve
def solve_funcaptcha(site_key, page_url):
    # Create a POST request to get the CAPTCHA solution
    url = "http://2captcha.com/in.php"
    data = {
        'key': API_KEY,
        'method': 'funcaptcha',
        'sitekey': site_key,  # Site key for Funcaptcha (can be found in the page's HTML)
        'pageurl': page_url,  # URL of the page containing the Funcaptcha
        'json': 1
    }

    response = requests.post(url, data=data)
    result = response.json()

    if result['status'] == 1:
        request_id = result['request']
        print(f"CAPTCHA requested successfully. Request ID: {request_id}")
        return request_id
    else:
        print("Failed to request CAPTCHA.")
        return None

# Step 2: Retrieve the solution
def get_solution(request_id):
    url = "http://2captcha.com/res.php"
    params = {
        'key': API_KEY,
        'action': 'get',
        'id': request_id,
        'json': 1
    }

    while True:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        result = response.json()

        if result['status'] == 1:
            print(f"Solution found: {result['solution']}")
            return result['solution']
        else:
            print("Waiting for solution...")
            time.sleep(5)

# Example usage
site_key = "YOUR_SITE_KEY"  # Find this in the website's HTML (for Funcaptcha)
page_url = "PAGE_URL"  # URL of the page with the Funcaptcha

# Request CAPTCHA
request_id = solve_funcaptcha(site_key, page_url)

if request_id:
    # Get the solution (polling every 5 seconds)
    solution = get_solution(request_id)
    print(f"Captcha solution: {solution}")

Explanation:

    solve_funcaptcha(): This sends a request to the 2Captcha API with the site key and the URL of the page where Funcaptcha is located. The API will return a request ID.
    get_solution(): After requesting the CAPTCHA, this function polls the 2Captcha API every 5 seconds to retrieve the solution once it is ready.

Note: You will need to provide the site key (unique to the page where Funcaptcha is located) and the page URL.
Step 4: Verify Captcha Solutions

After solving the CAPTCHA with 2Captcha, you need to use the solution in your web browser by simulating the process of filling the CAPTCHA.

For example, in a Chrome or Firefox extension, you would need to:

    Inject the solution into the website's form.
    Submit the form to proceed as normal.

Important Considerations:

    Security: Always ensure you're using API keys in a secure manner, avoid exposing them in public code.
    Compliance: Check the terms of service for any site you're interacting with to avoid violating rules.

Conclusion

To solve Funcaptcha automatically using a Chrome or Firefox extension, you can use services like 2Captcha that provide APIs to solve CAPTCHAs. You can either use ready-made extensions like 2Captcha or Buster for Chrome or Firefox, or you can integrate the 2Captcha API into a custom solution.
